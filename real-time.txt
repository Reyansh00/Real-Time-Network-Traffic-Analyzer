Problem Statement — Real-Time Network Traffic Analyzer

Modern operating systems provide only fragmented visibility into how local applications communicate over the network. System administrators, security analysts, and developers often lack an integrated view of:

which processes are opening network connections,

what domains/IPs they communicate with,

how much data they send/receive in real time, and

whether any of this traffic shows unusual or suspicious patterns.

Existing tools like netstat, ss, or Wireshark either provide raw packet-level data (too low-level), or lack process-level correlation (which specific program is causing the traffic).

There is no lightweight, beginner-friendly tool that links processes ↔ connections ↔ geography ↔ anomalies in real time.

Goal

Design and implement a cross-platform real-time network traffic analyzer that monitors system processes and their network activity, identifies suspicious behavior, and visualizes everything through a clean, interactive dashboard.

The system should be able to:

track active TCP/UDP connections at the process level,

log destination IPs/domains and geolocation,

measure bandwidth usage per process,

detect anomalies such as unusual outbound connections or high-frequency requests,

generate alerts for suspicious events, and

display insights through a modern UI with live graphs.
